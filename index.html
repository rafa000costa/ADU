            Preety is a middle school student with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with dyslexia. <br><br><br>
            She has difficulty reading, but she enjoys her literature class. Her school strated using online textbooks. <br><br><br>
            She was initially worried about using this new format, but using text-to-speech software that highlights the 
            text on the screen as it reads it aloud, she realized that she can focus on the content instead of struggling 
            over every word. <br><br><br> The text-to-speech software helps with other online text; but, her experience with websites varies. <br><br><br>
            Some sites use graphics in a way that helps her to focus on the content that she would like to read, while other sites 
            have distracting advertisements and moving content. <br><br><br> She has problems with online content when the navigation is unclear,
            and prefers site that have navigation cues including a navigation bar, search box, bread crumb trails, and a sitemap. <br><br><br>
            Her school is using an accessible library catalog online. Before it she had to go to the library to find books. <br><br> <br>
            Now she can search the catalog using her phone, tablet, or laptop. She struggles with spelling but the search feature 
            that suggets alternative spellings and correct words is helpful.
